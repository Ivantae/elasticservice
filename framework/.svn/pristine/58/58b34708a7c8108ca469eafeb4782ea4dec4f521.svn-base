## Elastic Service - SQL Query Repository Framework

Elastic Service is coded in Scala, Play Framework. Developers save SQL statements in the form of XML file in a certain directory. Once it starts SQLs in that directory loaded into the cache. On request through HTTP, Elastic Service maps given parameter's values by client into the corresponding SQL statement and then executes it on the database.

- elasticservice-sample-servlet : Sample servlet

### elasticservice

$ cd elasticservice
$ sbt
> compile   -> generates target\scala-2.11\classes
> package   -> generates target\scala-2.11\elasticservice_2.11-0.1.1.jar

### elasticservice-sample-play-dev

Copy elasticservice\generates target\scala-2.11\elasticservice_2.11-0.1.1.jar to elasticservice-sample-play-dev\lib

$ cd elasticservice-sample-play-dev
$ activator

### Making stage mode files

$ cd elasticservice-sample-play-dev
$ activator

To generate secret

[elasticservice-sample-play-dev] $ playGenerateSecret
[info] Generated new secret: QCYtAnfkaZiwrNwnxIlR6CTfG3gf90Latabg5241ABR5W1uDFNIkn

Copy the secret above and paste in conf/production.conf as the value of application.secret
For example:
application.secret="QCYtAnfkaZiwrNwnxIlR6CTfG3gf90Latabg5241ABR5W1uDFNIkn"

$ activator clean stage

Command above generates target/universal/stage directory.

### elasticservice-sample-play-prod

Copy all files under target/universal/stage directory to under ..\elasticservice-sample-play-prod

$ cd elasticservice-sample-play-prod
$ bin\elasticservice-sample.bat -Dconfig.resource=production.conf

To assign certain port and IP address. Default port is 9000

$ bin\elasticservice-sample.bat -Dconfig.resource=production.conf -Dhttp.port=9090 -Dhttp.address=127.0.0.1
